# Dictionary

This is a dictionary of terms used in my research

## Variable

A variable is a name that is used to store a value.

## Declaration

A declaration is the act of telling the computer that a variable exists and what type of data it will hold.

## Golang

Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled high-level programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. Go is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to use, with an emphasis on greater simplicity and safety. It has a large standard library, built-in concurrency, and is often used for building scalable network services and distributed systems.

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by Microsoft that adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript. TypeScript provides optional static typing, classes, and interfaces, and its goal is to help catch mistakes early through a type system and to make JavaScript development more efficient. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that it provides all the features and functionalities of JavaScript with some added features, and it compiles to JavaScript, which the browser understands. TypeScript provides "type safety" to JavaScript, and it extends JavaScript, providing a better developer experience

## Qwik

Qwik is a JavaScript framework that aims to achieve instant-on applications by delaying the execution and download of JavaScript for as long as possible, taking advantage of the browser's lazy loading capabilities. It achieves this through two main strategies: delaying execution and download of JavaScript, and serializing the execution state of the application and the framework on the server and resuming it on the client. Qwik is designed to provide near-instant startup performance on mobile devices and is fast because it is designed in a way where most of the JavaScript never needs to be downloaded or executed.

## Front-end development

In the context of web development, front-end refers to the part of a website that users can see and interact with, such as the graphical user interface (GUI) and the command line, including the design, navigating menus, texts, images, videos, etc. Front-end development focuses on the user-facing side of a website, and front-end developers ensure that visitors can easily interact with and navigate sites by using programming languages, design skills, and other tools.

The visual aspects of the website that can be seen and experienced by users are front-end. Front-end developers architect and develop websites and applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript, which run on the Open Web Platform or act as compilation input for non-web platform environments. They produce the code sent from a web server to a client/front-end to establish a user interface.

Front-end development requires technical expertise and creativity to ensure websites' user interfaces look correct and function properly.

## Back-end development

Back-end development refers to the development of server-side logic that powers websites and apps from behind the scenes. It includes all the code needed to store, organize, and process data, as well as ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers. Back-end developers are responsible for building and maintaining the mechanisms that process data and perform actions on websites. Unlike front-end developers, who control everything you can see on a website, back-end developers are involved in data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see.

Back-end code enables the communication between browsers and information from databases. Back-end developers focus on how a website functions, which means they might work with APIs, code that interacts with databases, libraries, data architecture, and more. They use programming languages such as Java, Ruby, Python, and .Net to create the server-side of a website or web application.

In a web application, front-end development renders the client-side, while back-end development renders the server-side. The client-side refers to whatever a user sees when they access a site in their web browser and is concerned with the visual components of the site. The server-side involves programming the web server and database supporting the website. Back-end development requires technical expertise and knowledge of server-side programming languages, databases, and web servers.

Together, front-end and back-end development help create web applications and websites, but as a specialty, they focus on creating different sides of a site. Back-end developers collaborate with front-end developers, product managers, principal architects, and website testers to build the structure of a website or application.
