# Dictionary

This is a dictionary of terms used in my research

## Variable

A variable is a name that is used to store a value.

## Declaration

A declaration is the act of telling the computer that a variable exists and what type of data it will hold.

## Golang

Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled high-level programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. Go is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to use, with an emphasis on greater simplicity and safety. It has a large standard library, built-in concurrency, and is often used for building scalable network services and distributed systems.

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by Microsoft that adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript. TypeScript provides optional static typing, classes, and interfaces, and its goal is to help catch mistakes early through a type system and to make JavaScript development more efficient. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that it provides all the features and functionalities of JavaScript with some added features, and it compiles to JavaScript, which the browser understands. TypeScript provides "type safety" to JavaScript, and it extends JavaScript, providing a better developer experience

## Qwik

Qwik is a JavaScript framework that aims to achieve instant-on applications by delaying the execution and download of JavaScript for as long as possible, taking advantage of the browser's lazy loading capabilities. It achieves this through two main strategies: delaying execution and download of JavaScript, and serializing the execution state of the application and the framework on the server and resuming it on the client. Qwik is designed to provide near-instant startup performance on mobile devices and is fast because it is designed in a way where most of the JavaScript never needs to be downloaded or executed.
